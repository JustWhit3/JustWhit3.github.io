*In this work, a method to be used for the measurement of the WbWb production differential cross-section as a function of variables sensitive to tt/tW interference is presented: tt represents the doubly-resonant production, while tW is the singly-resonant one. This method is being used in the data sample collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015-2018 and corresponding to √s = 13 TeV and L = 139 fb^{−1}. Single-and double-differential cross-sections extraction and comparison to theoretical predictions are described.*
