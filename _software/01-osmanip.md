Here I want to present you *osmanip*: my personal C++ library containing useful output-stream tools to customize your output stream. Probably there are already some similar libraries in the web that do the same job, but since I personally don't like them at all I preferred writing my own code for that. Thanks to this you can manipulate the output stream of your program with colors, styles (ex: bold, italics, etc...) and helper tools like progress bars and CPU-usage monitor objects. Using this feaures may be very useful to better read error messages or special information you want to be sure other users see when they run your code, or to adorn your general output stream log.
