This repository contains instructions about how to run a shell script to automatically install the [ROOT framework](https://github.com/root-project/root) on your computer by entering only one command in the terminal prompt! With this, you can install the release you prefer (which is directly downloaded from the official [ROOT website](https://root.cern/install/all_releases/)) for the major part of the most used operating systems.
