*IGStatTools* is a desktop app to retrieve general statistics about an Instagram profile, using the [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) API.

I decided to develope this app since I didn't trust about all the other mobile and desktop app: the problem is that I was not sure if all my personal Instagram credentials and data was safe. Therefore I decided to create my own app, adding the features I needed, in order to monitor the statistics of my profile. The code is open-source and you can see (in particular [here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/IGStatTools/blob/main/src/Graphics/Frames/LoginFrame.py)) that the treatment of your personal data is secure and anything is stolen, like can happens with many of the other private apps.
