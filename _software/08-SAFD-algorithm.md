This program computes the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f_{m,l}}"> coefficients of a function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f(\theta, \phi)}"> development in a spherical harmonics convergent series, by using a standard mathematical [algorithm](#algorithm-explanation).

When running the program, you have simply to input the generic shape of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f(\theta, \phi)}"> equation and the values of m and l and the coefficients will be calculated.

Some program features:
 - Can calculate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f_{m,l}}"> coefficients for any generic <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f(\theta, \phi)}"> function, entered by the user during the program running.
 - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{green}{f_{m,l}}"> coefficients are expressed as complex numbers.
 - It works well for each negative or positive value of m (with almost 99% accuracy for m < 5).
