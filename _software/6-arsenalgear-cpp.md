This is a C++17/20 library containing a set of generic utils I developed for other projects. There are several sub-headers / modules related to the various topics (math, iostream and others). Existing tools are constantly updated and new ones are added once their development is required for other projects. Some projects in which I am using this library are, for example: [osmanip](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip) and [SAFD-algorithm](https://github.com/JustWhit3/SAFD-algorithm).
