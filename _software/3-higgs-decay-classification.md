Study of the Higgs boson Yukawa coupling to tau leptons using the 2012 ATLAS Run-2 dataset. Particular focus is dedicated to the usage of machine learning classification algorithms to classify the Higgs decay channel H to tautau as signal with respect to the other background processes.

For the classification have been considered the cases in which there are 0,1 or 2 jets in the final state.

This classification has been performed on the free dataset from the [Higgs Boson Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/overview) ([dataset](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/328)), that contains data related to the case in which we have in the final state a tau that decays hadronically and the other one that decays leptonically (data for same leptonic or hadronic decays of the tau are omitted).

Analysis scripts are located into the [python](https://github.com/JustWhit3/higgs-decay-classification/blob/master/scripts/python) folder, while Jupyter Notebooks examples are located into the [jupyter](https://github.com/JustWhit3/higgs-decay-classification/blob/master/scripts/jupyter) folder. The purpose of this latter is to show interactively the various analysis passages.
