This library contains a set of generic utils (functions and classes), for different languages, I developed for other projects. There are several sub-headers / modules related to the various topics (math, iostream and others). There are folders related to each programming languages I developed tools for. You can simply enter one of the folder with a language name and explore the various tools. You can also easily install the libraries using one of the installation scripts of the [scripts](https://github.com/JustWhit3/arsenalgear/tree/main/scripts) folder and run an example code for each programming language or following the guides.
> **NOTE**: the various libraries for different languages don't necessary contain the same functions / classes written in different languages. The contents are usually different.

Existing tools are constantly updated and new ones are added once their development is required for other projects.

Some projects in which I am using this library are, for example: [osmanip](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip) and [SAFD-algorithm](https://github.com/JustWhit3/SAFD-algorithm).
