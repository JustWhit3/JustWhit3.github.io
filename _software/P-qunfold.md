title: "QUnfold"
excerpt: <b><span style="color:red;">Keywords</span></b> - <i>Python, quantum annealing, unfolding, statistics</i>. <br/><br/>A module to perform the statistical unfolding / deconvolution / matrix-inversion problem using quantum annealing with D-Wave quantum computer.
collection: software
---

This module consists of an implementation of the unfolding statistical approach using quantum computation and in particular a quadratic unconstrain binary optimization approach. To find a detailed implementation of the model you can look at this wiki page. This software is based on NumPy, but you can easily run it also using ROOT framework data (see below).
