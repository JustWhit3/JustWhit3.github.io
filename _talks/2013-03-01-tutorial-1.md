*We presented our work related to the application of a machine learning classification algorithm on a subset from the ATLAS analysis data, simulated using Monte Carlo methods at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. We tried two complementary machine learning approaches: Deep Neural Networks and Boosted Decision Trees. The combination of both outputs was found to give the most significant separation of signal and background events.*
