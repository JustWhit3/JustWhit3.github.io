Measurement of the differential cross-sections for the inclusive production of ttbar pairs at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at parton-level. The single, double and triple differential cross-sections are measured as a function of the kinematic variables of the ttbar system or the hadronically decaying top-quark and extrapolated to the full phase-space.
