Study of the Higgs boson Yukawa coupling to τ leptons using the 2012 ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and an instantaneous luminosity of 20.3 fb^−1. Particular focus is dedicated to the usage of machine learning classification algorithms to classify the Higgs decay channel H → ττ as signal with respect to the other background processes.
