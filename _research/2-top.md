Measurement of the WbWB single- and double- differential cross-sections in the dilepton channel in pp collisions, using the full ATLAS Run-2 dataset corresponding to a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and L = 139 fb^âˆ’1. Particular focus is dedicated to the study of the quantum interference properties of singly- and doubly-resonant top-quark production processes in the WbWb phase-space.
