title: "Development of offline tools for ATLAS RPC detector performance monitoring analyzing the DCS data"

My work is focused on developing offline tools for ATLAS RPC detector performance monitoring for Run 3 operations. These tools will evaluate impact of RPC detector defects on RPC DQ. This information will be then used for ATLAS data analysis assessment and for offline performance studies of RPC detector.
