title: "Development of offline tools for data quality monitoring of RPC detector status for Run 3 operations of the ATLAS experiment"
excerpt: <i>Offline detector analysis</i>
collection: research

My work is focused on developing offline tools for data quality (DQ) monitoring of RPC detector status for Run 3 operations. These tools will evaluate impact of RPC detector defects on RPC DQ. This information will be then used for ATLAS data analysis assessment and for offline performance studies of RPC detector.
