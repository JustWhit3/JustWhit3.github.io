I'm a PhD student in **physics** at the [*Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna*](https://www.unibo.it/it), complemented by a solid foundation in **computer science**, backed by over 3 years of combined experience in physics and IT domains. 

Currently engaged in research for the CERN  [*ATLAS* experiment](https://atlas.cern/), my primary interests lie in **software engineering**, **quantum computing**, and **high-performance computing** applied to **particle physics**. Additionally, I'm keen on exploring **data science** and **artificial intelligence** areas.

I am also passionate about **coding** and **software development** in general and I like learning new programming languages and develop new algorithms and libraries as a hobby. My **personal projects** can be found directly at my [GitHub](https://github.com/JustWhit3) page.
