I am a **PhD student** in particle physics and teaching tutor at the [*Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna*](https://www.unibo.it/it), associate member of the [*Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare* (INFN)](https://www.bo.infn.it/) - Bologna section and member of the CERN [*ATLAS* experiment](https://atlas.cern/).

My scientific interests are related to **elementary particle physics** and in particular to top-quark studies. I am actually part of the ATLAS top-quark analysis team and also work in the technical detector upgrade field, with particular focus on the ATLAS muon spectrometer analysis studies. Within my researches I deal in particular with **data analysis** and **software development**. My working projects are hosted at my [GitLab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/gbianco) page (some of them are private, so cannot be viewed).

Other fields that fascinate me are: data science, computer science, quantum computing and cosmology. I am also passionate about **coding** and **software development** and I like learning new programming languages and develop new algorithms and libraries as a hobby. My **personal projects** can be found directly at my [GitHub](https://github.com/JustWhit3) and page.
