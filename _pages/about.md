I am a PhD student in particle physics and teaching tutor at the [*Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna*](https://www.unibo.it/it), associate member of the [*Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare* (INFN)](https://www.bo.infn.it/) - Bologna section and member of the CERN [*ATLAS* experiment](https://atlas.cern/).

My scientific interests are related to elementary particle physics and in particular to top-quark studies. I am actually part of the ATLAS top-quark analysis team and also work into the technical detector upgrade field, with particular focus on the ATLAS muon spectrometer analysis studies.

My daily working tools are related in particular to data analysis and software development.

Other fields that fascinate me are: data science, computer science, quantum computing and cosmology.

I am also passionate about coding and software development and I like learning new programming languages and develop new algorithms and libraries as a hobby. My personal projects can be found directly at my personal [GitHub](https://github.com/JustWhit3) page.
