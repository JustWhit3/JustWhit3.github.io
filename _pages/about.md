I am a PhD student in particle physics and my main scientific interests are related to elementary particle physics and in particular to top-quark studies. I mostly prefer to work with data analysis and data science tools, together with computer programming algorithms, in order to extract physics results from data. I am also fascinated by computer science and in particular by quantum computing.
